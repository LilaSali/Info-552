    <p> <H1> What is Art?</H1>
      <b> Bird In Space</b> </p>
    <p> This is me next to Constantin Brancusi's <i> Bird In Space</i> from 1924. One of 16 different variations of the statue made from 1923-1940. Two of which are at the Philadelphia Musuem of Art. I loved <i> Bird in Space</i> from the moment I saw it. It's just so weird. To me, it reminded me that no one has seen a bird in space. So no one knows what it looks like and it could look like this sculpture. Brancusi's inspiration was the essence of flight and beauty of movement. He was fascinated by birds, but who isn't? The statue was also a part of an unprecendented court case, Brancusi vs. United States. While being shipped to the U.S. the <i> Bird In Space </i> was taxed as if it was a kitchen object, not art which was untaxed. The artist and his friends appealed the claim and after a long battle over abstraction and the questioning what is art, they won. </p>
    <p> "Bird in Space looks like nothing we would recognize as a bird. The simplicity of the abstract shape conveys what is truly real for the artist: the essence of the thing, rather than its external appearance. The pristine shine of the polished bronze atop the smooth black marble makes the sculpture practically disappear, as the surface reflects back the rest of the room. Brancusi explored the theme of the soaring bird in more than thirty marble and bronze versions over the course of four decades." - Philadelphia Musuem of Art webpage </p>
